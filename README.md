# CurseBound

## Overview

**CurseBound** is a 2D turn-based role-playing game (RPG) developed in Java. Set in a fantasy-horror world during medieval times, the game is overrun by mythological creatures like Goblins, Dragons, and Kobolds. Players can choose from three characters, each representing a difficulty level (easy, normal, hard), and their mission is to survive in this nightmarish realm. The journey culminates in a final boss battle, and victory signifies the completion of the game. If defeated, the player must restart from the beginning, enhancing the challenge and intensity.

CurseBound blends horror, mythology, and captivating visuals to deliver a unique and immersive RPG experience.
