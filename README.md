1. Overview:

CurseBound is a 2D turn-based role-playing game (RPG) developed in Java. The game immerses the players in a fantasy-horror world that is set in medieval times and is plagued by mythological creatures such as Goblins, Dragons, and Kobolds. Players choose from three characters, each representing a difficulty level (easy, normal, hard), to traverse through the game. The objective is to survive in this nightmarish realm by strategically defeating monster encounters, leading up to a pivotal boss battle. In the decisive showdown, emerging victorious against the boss marks the climax of the game, resulting in its completion. On the other hand, facing defeat at the hands of any adversary triggers a game-over screen, requiring the players to restart their journey from the beginning. 
CurseBound aims to blend horror, mythology, and captivating visuals to deliver an unforgettable and immersive RPG experience.
